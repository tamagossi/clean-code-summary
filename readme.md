Greetings :wave:::wave:::wave::,

This is the summary of :book:&nbsp; Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert C. Martin&nbsp;:book:. 
I am trying to write this summary to strengthen my understanding of this book and try to implement Feynman Technique.

I hope I can make the sentence as simple as easy to understand for non-native English speakers (like me), so feel free to contribute, comment, and pull requests are a huge welcome :grin:

<h4 id="chapter-1-1">1. Why It is Matter</h4>

Creating a clean code is important, it might help you to add more features in the future easily. Have you ever been slowed down by someone else's messy code? That's why writing a good code is important


<h4 id="chapter-1-2">2. What is Clean Code</h4>

Clean Code ...

* is elegant and efficient
* is simple and direct
* has meaningful names and is self-documenting
* is pleasing to read, and reads like well-written prose
* does one thing well
* does not tempt the developer to write bad code - on the flip side, when others change bad code, they tend to make it worse
* never hides the designer's intent but is rather full of crisp abstractions and straightforward lines of control
* is when each method you read turns out to be pretty much what you expected (Least Astonishment Principle)
* can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author 
* has unit and acceptance tests
* is minimal (KISS and YAGNI)
* does not repeat itself (DRY Principle)
